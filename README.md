Menu Items- Each JMenu contains several JMenuItem components, allowing users to interact with various features or commands.
Event Handling- The application includes basic event handling, enabling the menu items to trigger specific actions.

Tech Stack:
Java- The primary programming language used to develop the application.
Swing- A GUI widget toolkit for Java, used to create the application's user interface.
